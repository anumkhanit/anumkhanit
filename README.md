# Hi there! I'm Anum, an <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/anumkhanit">IT Professional</h1>

## About Me

My journey as a **writer** has been whacky and different, blending the mystical allure of supernatural thrillers with the heart-pounding excitement of romance, all while embracing the ever-evolving world of **technology**. Born from Pakistan and have lived in the USA since 2008.

I'm currently pursuing an Associate Degree in **Information Technology** at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) and CourseCareers, where I'm honing my tech skills, learning about **Scripting**, **Network Sharing and Security Protocols**, **Active Directory**, **Ticketing System**, and many more.
